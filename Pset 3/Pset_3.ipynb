    "A break point $k$ for an hypothesis set $\\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the minimum number of points that cannot be shattered by $\\mathcal{H}$. In other words, it doesn't exist any set of $k-$points for which the hypothesis set is able to reproduce all the $2^k$ possible classifications. \n",

    "\n",
    "We first observe that it is always possible to find a set of $4$ points that can be completely shattered by the Perceptron. Take the fourth point to be not co-planar with the other three: we will call the plane defined by the first three points $\\Sigma$ in the following. \n",
    "The intersection of our classification plane (not co-planar with the first three points) with $\\Sigma$ is a line and we already know a line can completely shatter three points on a plane. Furthermore, we can tilt the angle of the plane to reproduce both possible classifications for the $4$th point. Since we found a configuration of $4$ points that can be shattered by a plane in $3D$, the break point for the $3D$ Perceptron must be at least $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now give a geometric proof that the break point for the $3D$ Perceptron is $5$. Without loss of generality, we take the five points to be not-coplanar. We choose four of them in order to make a tetrahedron such that the fifth point lay outside of it, within the partition of the space identified by one of the faces of the tetrahedron $\\Sigma^\\prime$. We label the point outside the tetrahedron $5$, the three points that define $\\Sigma^\\prime$ as $2,3,4$ and the opposite point $1$. The dichotomy $\\{+1,-1,-1,-1,+1\\}$, cannot be realized by any plane, since the portion of space delimited by any classification plane which separate all the points of $\\Sigma^\\prime$ from point $1$, will also include by construction point $5$, attributing to point $5$ the same classification value as points $2,3,4$. Hence, the break point for the $3D$ Perceptron is $5$.\n",
